Welcome to ElbeClean, the community-driven platform that's making Hamburg great again. Our mission is simple: keep Hamburg's beautiful waterways clean through the power of community action.

Built for Hamburg's diverse community, our app supports three languages: English, German, and Polish. Watch as we instantly translate the entire interface for maximum accessibility.

Users can easily report pollution with our intuitive interface, browse and join community cleanup events, and track their environmental impact through our gamified leaderboard system.

Now let me activate our presentation demo mode to show you the real-time community engagement that makes ElbeClean special.

In demo mode, you can see live notifications as community members report pollution, join events, and earn achievements. This simulates the real-time engagement we expect from Hamburg's environmental community.

Our impact dashboard shows real environmental results. In demo mode, you can see how these numbers could grow with wider adoption. This isn't just an app - it's a movement to make Hamburg's waterways the cleanest in Europe.

ElbeClean: where technology meets environmental action. Ready to make Hamburg great again, one cleanup at a time.
