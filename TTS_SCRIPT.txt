Welcome to ElbeClean - making Hamburg's waterways clean through community action.

Our app supports three languages: English, German, and Polish. Watch as we instantly translate the entire interface.

Users can report pollution, join cleanup events, and track their impact through our gamified leaderboard.

Let me activate demo mode to show real-time community engagement.

In demo mode, you see live notifications as members report pollution, join events, and earn achievements. This simulates the engagement we expect from Hamburg's community.

Our impact dashboard shows real environmental results. This isn't just an app - it's a movement to make Hamburg's waterways the cleanest in Europe.

ElbeClean: where technology meets environmental action. Making Hamburg great again, one cleanup at a time.
